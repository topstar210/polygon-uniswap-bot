Usage
======================
1. Generate a new bot wallet address and extract the private key into a raw 32-byte format.
2. Deploy the included BundleExecutor.sol to Ethereum, from a secured account, with the address of the newly created wallet as the constructor argument
3. Transfer WETH to the newly deployed BundleExecutor

_It is important to keep both the bot wallet private key and bundleExecutor owner private key secure. The bot wallet attempts to not lose WETH inside an arbitrage, but a malicious user would be able to drain the contract._

```
$ npm install

```
